**COURSE DESCRIPTION**  
  
This course covers the similarities and differences in human societies, from hunting and gathering to industrialized societies. It compares and contrasts American beliefs and practices with those of other societies.  
  
**COURSE GOALS**  
  
1. Demonstrate an understanding of culture.  
2. Demonstrate the knowledge of culture’s role in society.
3. Develop a sense of cultural relativity.
4. Cite the general characteristics of the four-field discipline of anthropology.
5. Apply at least two different theoretical schools to interpret the same cultural practice.  
  
**OVERVIEW OF THE COURSE**  
  
This course will introduce you to the key terms, theories, and perspectives which guide the systematic study of human beings in their physical and cultural worlds. In particular, we will: (a) define the term “culture” and learn how anthropologists identify and analyze culture in social groups around the world; (b) understand the processes of technological change and development which have shaped and continue to shape human social organization; and (c) apply these ideas to an examination of contemporary society and our own individual lives. In the process we will encourage each other to develop an “anthropological perspective” as a means of understanding (if not doing something about) the community(ies) in which we live.  
  
In addition to understanding how anthropologists identify and study patterns in human social organization, this course is also designed to enhance your critical thinking and writing skills and will require you to stay abreast of current events in order to connect anthropological theories to contemporary conditions. Pay attention to the news and browse the internet regularly with a critical eye. As we proceed through the course, you will learn new ways of interpreting world events by analyzing the social behavior of participants, from political leaders to individual citizens, and from international communities to individual family members. Finally, in this course we will often discuss controversial topics and share personal experiences in an effort to build a comprehensive understanding of the topics. Remember to be honest as you share your opinions, respectful as you hear the opinions of others, and protective of the privacy of all members of the class.

**TEXTS AND RESOURCES**  
  
1. Most of the resources you will need for this class will be linked directly through Blackboard. You should make sure you have updated versions of Adobe products (Flash and Reader) and are very comfortable navigating the internet.

2. You may also be required to do small independent research projects on the internet or through BCC library databases. Make sure you have a library code and are familiar with the library’s website. 

3. BCC has assigned one textbook for this course, Cultural Anthropology: A Global Perspective by Raymond Scupin. The readings assigned from the textbook will dive more deeply into the topic each week, and you’ll learn more details about the field of anthropology. The textbook will enhance your learning in the course, but quiz questions and writing topics (as described below) will be pulled from the articles, case studies, blogs, etc. assigned in each lesson module. It is possible to be successful in this course without the textbook.

**COURSE REQUIREMENTS**
  
You can accumulate up to 1,200 points in this course:

1. *Class discussions/group work (250 points)* – Class attendance/participation is a critical part of this course. Each week you will complete in-class activities designed to generate reflection and discussion about the week’s topics. You must come to each class prepared. Your participation score will be determined by your ability to contribute meaningfully to these activities, including group discussions, and by your general input in broader class conversations. **10-25 points per class.**

2. *Journals (300 points)* – During the semester, you will complete three 950-1,000 word essays (this works out to about three double-spaced pages each) in response to a specific prompt. Students have been randomly assigned due dates for each of these three journals. Check the “Journal Schedule” in Course Documents for a complete list of journal due dates during the semester. You will not have to write a journal during quiz weeks or during the week your research project is due. If a journal has been assigned to you during a particular week, instructions will appear for you in Blackboard. Journals are designed to evaluate your engagement with the week’s material and to help you develop your writing skills. I will return edited copies of your journal submissions to you;. Please work to incorporate these suggestions into future journals. **100 points each.**

3. *Quizzes (250 points)* – You will take five short quizzes as scheduled throughout the semester (refer to the course calendar on Blackboard for dates). **50 points each.**

4. *Mini-ethnography (300 points)* – This is an opportunity for you to apply the theories and explore the techniques of anthropology by doing a little “participant observation” of your own in the form of a 3-4 page “mini-ethnography.” You can find details about the project under the “Research Project” tab on Blackboard. Later in the course, you will be asked to share a brief description of your project with the class, so you should begin thinking about your project early in the semester. 

5. *Final exam (100 points)* – Details will follow. I do not place a great deal of emphasis on final exams, so this will not be an especially difficult test. Like the quizzes, if you have kept up with the course you will be well prepared for this exam.

- *Unexcused absences.* You will be allowed one unexcused absence this semester.  If you have a work or family conflict, are not feeling well, have transportation troubles, etc., you can use this one opportunity to make up the week’s work, no questions asked, by the time the next class begins. If you arrive later than 15 minutes after class has begun without prior notice, this counts as an absence. Out of respect for your classmates, please arrive on time.  You will not be permitted to make up class work for more than one unexcused absence.

- *Excused absences.* Any excused absence must be documented. Emergencies (a death in the family or illnesses/ injuries requiring a hospital visit) must be documented.  Please note that work and family conflicts, undocumented illnesses, or transportation troubles do not constitute emergencies.  You will be permitted to make up work for no more than two documented excused absences. 

- *Quizzes.* Quizzes are scheduled at the beginning of class. Missed quizzes can be made up only with prior arrangement under exceptional circumstances. Please make arrangements if you know you will have a conflict on one of these dates.  If you know you will be absent or late to class, you must arrange an alternate quiz time prior to the beginning of class on the date of the quiz.  

- *Research papers.* Research papers will be docked 50 points for each late day.

- *Incompletes.* The grade of “I” (incomplete) allows students additional time to complete the requirements of this course, while the grade of “X” permits students to drop the course after the add/drop deadline. In this course, in accordance with college policies, these grades will be given only to students who (a) have been making adequate progress in the course and (b) have experienced exceptional, documented, and unforeseen hardships that require additional consideration. I very rarely award either of these grades.

- *Plagiarism.* Given the nature of the writing assignments for this course, it will be more work for you to try to plagiarize a discussion response than it would be to simply write the response in the first place.  However, it is important to stress that my tolerance level for plagiarism is zero.  Considering the extremely competitive job market you are preparing to enter, you are doing yourself no favors if you don’t view each assignment (in all your classes) as an opportunity to improve your own skill set.  Your instructors have considerable experience evaluating student writing, and it is usually very clear when your written work is not your own.  If you incorporate an outside resource (a website, for example), please provide a reference and use “quotation marks” around any direct quotes.  And remember: If you can find it online, I can find it online. In this course, if you are caught plagiarizing to any extent, you will automatically receive zero points for that assignment. There are absolutely no exceptions to this policy.  Depending on the severity of the plagiarism, you may also face additional academic penalties according to college policies. Assume you will be caught, and do not plagiarize. I am always available to help if you find researching and writing to be especially challenging.

- Be sure to keep copies of all your graded quizzes in the event of any grading disputes.

**WRITING GUIDELINES**  
  
Learning to communicate effectively through writing is crucial to success in both your academic and professional careers. You will have ample opportunity to improve your writing skills throughout this course. Here are some general guidelines for writing journals:
  
| **Grade** | **Guidelines for Journal Assignments**
| :---: | :--- |
| A | Journal is concise, well-organized, and addresses all the major points of the assignment, supported by material from class discussions and readings. Thesis statement is easily identifiable and clearly explains the content of the journal. Each body paragraph addresses only one supporting claim and provides ample support for that claim. Concluding paragraph summarizes all major points and explains their significance to the thesis statement. Language and sentence structure are creative, descriptive, and free of grammar or spelling errors. |
| B | Journal is concise, well-organized, and addresses most the major points of the assignment, supported by material from class discussions and readings. Thesis statement is easily identifiable and clearly explains the content of the journal. Each body paragraph addresses only one supporting claim and provides ample support for that claim. Concluding paragraph summarizes all major points and explains their significance to the thesis statement. Language and sentence structure are choppy and repetitive. Some grammar and spelling errors. |
| C | Journal fails to address many of the major points of the assignment and is poorly organized. Journal does not adequately incorporate material from class discussions and readings. Thesis statement does not clearly explain the content of the journal, and body paragraphs contain irrelevant information or do not support thesis statement. Concluding paragraph fails to connect the major points to the thesis statement. Language and sentence structure are choppy and repetitive.  Some grammar and spelling errors. |
| D | Journal fails to address most of the major points of the assignment and is poorly organized. Journal does not incorporate any material from class discussions and readings. Thesis statement is difficult to identify, and body paragraphs contain irrelevant information or do not clearly support thesis statement. Concluding paragraph fails to connect the major points to the thesis statement. Language and sentence structure are choppy and repetitive. Significant grammar and spelling errors. |
| F | Journal fails to address any of the major points of the assignment and is poorly organized. Journal does not incorporate any material from class discussions and readings. Journal does not have a thesis statement, and body paragraphs have no clear direction. Concluding paragraph fails to summarize major points of the essay. Language and sentence structure are choppy and repetitive. Significant grammar and spelling errors. **Journal has included facts, quotations, or themes from a published source without proper documentation.** |
